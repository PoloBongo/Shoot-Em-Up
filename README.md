# Shoot-Em-Up

Shooter created by myself with the help of 4 other students over the course of 2 weeks as a project, so the game is not finished but it is fully playable.

The shooter is made in Python using the Pygame library.

Game contents:

- Launcher
- Settings Menu
- Cosmetic Menu
- Endless Mode
- Boss Fight

Here are some screenshots of the shooter :
