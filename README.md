# Shoot-Em-Up

Shooter created by myself with the help of 4 other students over the course of 2 weeks as a project, so the game is not finished but it is fully playable.

The shooter is made in Python using the Pygame library.

Game contents:

- Launcher
- Settings Menu
- Cosmetic Menu
- Endless Mode
- Boss Fight

To launch the game, follow these steps:

- Download the game and open the mini_studio folder in your Visual Studio Code.
- Navigate to the launcher.py file and open a terminal.
- Make sure you have Python (it was made in Python 3), pip, and the Python plugin on VSCode.
- Simply type "pip install pygame" in the terminal and launch the launcher.py file in the top right corner.
